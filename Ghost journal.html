        <p>1. During the Ghost Event take a photo of the ghost. If the ghost disappears - it is Phantom.</p>
        <p>2. If you can't tell wether or not the ghost disappeared by itself look at the photo you took. If it says "Ghost" 
            underneath, but you don't see a ghost on the photo - it is Phantom </p>
        <p>3. During the hunt see if a ghost blinks very slowly. The minimum blink time for Phantom is 1 second(up to 2 seconds). 
            That is it disappears for 1 second (or longer) during the blink</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>How to rule out</h4>
        <p>During the hunt if the blink is <b>shorter</b> than 1 second(0.3 seconds for normal ghosts) - It is not a Phantom</p>

        <p>2. The longer player is in the room with Thaye the older she gets. Thus weakening her abilities</p>
        <p>3. If a player stays for long period of time in a ghost room Thaye will get older and initiate hunt at 15% Sanity with a speed of 1 m/s</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>How to identify</h4>
        <p>1. Very agressive at the start of the game(tries to lower your sanity) and very passive at the further stages. So if you see the decrease in the speed over a period of time - It might be Thaye</p>
